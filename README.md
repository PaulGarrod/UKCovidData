# UKCovidData

Using the UK Government Covid Data API, I created a website which shows the latest Covid stats for the UK.

To see information from another date, select a new date and the stats from the selected date will display.

Data include: Daily Deaths, Cumulative Deaths, Daily Cases and Cumulative Cases throughout the whole of the UK.
